# 📡 Kafka-Spark-FastAPI Sensor Stream Processing

A real-time data pipeline for ingesting, processing, and exposing sensor data using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Structured Streaming, and FastAPI, all containerized using Docker Compose.


## Overview

This project demonstrates a real-world streaming architecture where:

- 📥 **Kafka** receives continuous sensor data streams
- 🔥 **Spark** consumes and processes this data in real-time
- 🌐 **FastAPI** exposes processed insights via REST APIs
- 🐳 Everything runs as isolated services using **Docker Compose**
